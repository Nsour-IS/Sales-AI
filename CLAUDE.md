## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key

# AI Provider Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Computer Vision APIs
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_google_vision_key
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup
```sql
-- Run the complete database-schema.sql in your Supabase project
-- This creates all tables, RLS policies, and sample data
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy and fill environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Add your actual API keys
```

### 3. Development Start
```bash
npm run dev
# Project will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Principles

### Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Tailwind for all styling (mobile-first approach)
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- Server-side rendering with Supabase SSR
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Mobile-First Design
- Optimized for tablet displays in showrooms
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Responsive camera controls
- Fast loading and smooth animations

### AI Integration Strategy
- Database-first approach for product information
- AI enhances rather than replaces structured data
- Confidence scoring for all AI predictions
- Fallback systems for AI failures

### Security & Performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) for all database operations
- Image processing optimization
- Efficient API rate limiting
- User session management
